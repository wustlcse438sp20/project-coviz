In this file you should include:

Any information you think we should know about your submission
* Is there anything that doesn't work? Why?
* Is there anything that you did that you feel might be unclear? Explain it here.

All of the features that are in the project proposal have been implemented and they all work in the intended way. Something that might be unclear is that the heatmap is only given the infection location data in the cell that you are currently in. The cell level we are using is kinda small so the heatmap will only be for a small area around the user's location.
